The project is divided into 2 parts, scraping and visualisation.
Scraping:  First run MahaCovidScraping.py to scrape the web (https://covidindia.org/) and create a csv file (MahaCovid.csv) in your default directory.
Visualisation: Run the MahaCovidVisual.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook File), where I have created 5 plots displaying the various parameters of Covid-19 state-wise and district-wise
               using a simple and stacked bar plots, time series of active cases and recovery rate and a subplot showing the inverse ratio of the %recovery rate to the 
               active cases by month.

Note: Libraries used/required are requests, beautifulsoup, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
FYI- The csv files attached along with the code contains RAW data upto 9th January 2021. Also the .py format of visualising part is added, its advisible to 
use Jupyter Notebook for ease.
